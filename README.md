# ArtApp

Currently, there is no SQLAlchemy command to GET anything. It wasn't workig so I just tried to get it to print "Hola" if the request just goes through. 

app.py is the python 

in templates and static, you'll find the basic HTML and CSS I used just so I could see that the code and Flask are working.
